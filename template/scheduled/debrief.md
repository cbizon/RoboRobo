Prepare the morning debrief for the {{name}} research program, and wait for
{{scientist}} to discuss it.

Work in {{repo}}. Run `uv run --project {{roborobo}} program check`. Read
DIRECTION.md, PROGRAM.md, the latest session summary in sessions/, the
instruction it followed, and the checker's review of it in reviews/. Then
write the debrief for a scientist who didn't watch the night and hasn't read
the session files or transcripts.

The instruction's "Asked" section is what {{scientist}} asked for, in
{{scientist}}'s words. The debrief answers those questions as they were
asked. If the session answered a different question, or built something
other than what was asked, say that; don't adopt the session's framing.

Organize it around lines of research, not around the order of the night or
the files you read. A line of research is one thread of work: a method being
developed, a comparison, a baseline, a question from PROGRAM.md. Everything
about a line goes in its own section, in one place.

1. Opening: one or two sentences. How many decisions are waiting, and the
   single most important finding (the checker's, if it changes what the
   session concluded).
2. Terms: a line each for the terms the debrief depends on (methods,
   conditions, checks). Define anything else where it is first used. Never
   use a name, label or id that the debrief hasn't introduced.
3. What you asked: each item from the instruction's "Asked" section, word
   for word, followed by the answer in the same terms: yes, no, a number,
   or "not answered" with why. Add the checker's verdict on whether it was
   answered, and anything the session did differently from what was asked.
   For a fallback night, say there was no instruction.
4. One section per line of research that was active, each in this order:
   - what it is and why it is being done;
   - what was built or run (which conditions, how many starts, how long);
   - what the agent concluded;
   - what the checker found: whether each claim holds, is doubtful or is
     broken, and why. A challenged claim is not a headline result;
   - what stands, and what is still open.
   Give numbers with what they mean. Say which item under "What you asked"
   the line serves, or that nobody asked for it.
5. How the session ran: the checker's verdict and the facts behind it,
   anything `program check` reported (failures, approvals in the last day),
   the budget, and discrepancies in the records.
6. Decisions for {{scientist}}: only questions {{scientist}} can answer
   from this debrief alone, without reading the ledger. Put each in plain
   language, in the terms {{scientist}} has used, with the line it belongs
   to, what happens by default, and your recommendation with a one-line
   reason. If you can't put a question that way, don't ask it: say the
   agent's default applies.
7. A draft of tonight's instruction, in the format below.

Report only what the files say, and mark any inference of your own as
yours. Then discuss.

## The instruction

The instruction has two sections (see instructions/README.md):

- `## Asked`: a numbered list of what {{scientist}} asked for in this
  conversation, in {{scientist}}'s own words, quoted and not paraphrased.
  One item per request. Trim, but don't reword, merge or reinterpret.
- `## Details`: what the agent needs to carry each item out (conditions,
  order, approvals, housekeeping), written for the agent, each point tied to
  an item by number or marked as housekeeping.

Details may add to an item. They may not narrow or defer part of it. If you
think part of a request should wait or be done differently, tell
{{scientist}} so before saving, and put the agreed wording under Asked.

When {{scientist}} agrees on tonight's instruction (Details under about 250
words), save it as instructions/YYYY-MM-DD.md dated today and commit it on
`main`.
