Prepare the morning debrief for the {{name}} research program, and wait for
{{scientist}} to discuss it.

Work in {{repo}}. Run `uv run --project {{roborobo}} program check`. Read
DIRECTION.md, PROGRAM.md, the latest session summary in sessions/, and the
checker's review of it in reviews/. Then write the debrief for a scientist
who didn't watch the night, in this order:

1. Last night in brief: what the session was for and what was learned, in
   two or three sentences.
2. The experiments: one short paragraph each (question, what was tried,
   what happened, what it means). Numbers in words with their meaning; no
   ids or internal labels.
3. What the checker found: which claims hold, which are doubtful or broken,
   and why. A challenged claim is not a headline result.
4. How the session ran: the checker's verdict and the facts behind it, and
   anything `program check` reported (failures, approvals in the last day).
5. Decisions for {{scientist}}: each of the agent's questions in plain
   language, what happens by default, and your recommendation with a
   one-line reason.

Report only what the files say. Then discuss. When {{scientist}} agrees on
tonight's instruction (under about 250 words, written for the agent), save
it as instructions/YYYY-MM-DD.md dated today and commit it on `main`.
